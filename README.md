# GifTastic Assignment

## Description

I made a simple page that brings up gifs of various Star Wars characters when clicking on a specific button. The gifs are static until clicked on. You can also type in whatever you\'92d like to search for to populate more gifs.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Giphy API

I used the GIPHY API to pull the gifs from their servers. jQuery was used to write the elements to the HTML, and some Bootstrap for the CSS.
