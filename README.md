# GifTastic Assignment

### Overview

Here I made a simple page that brings up gifs of various Star Wars characters when clicking on a specific button. The gifs are static until clicked on. The user can also type in whatever they\'92d like to search for more gifs.

### How it works

I used the GIPHY API to pull the gifs from their servers. jQuery was used to write the elements to the HTML, and some Bootstrap for the CSS.
