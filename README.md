\
### Overview\
\
Here I made a simple page that brings up gifs of various Star Wars characters when clicking on a specific button. The gifs are static until clicked on. The user can also type in whatever they\'92d like to search for more gifs.\
\
### How it works\
\
I used the GIPHY API to pull the gifs from their servers. jQuery was used to write the elements to the HTML, and some Bootstrap for the CSS.\
